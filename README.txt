The model was created using a standard built-in library available on the net to predict faces. It uses Dlib face shape predictor 
to read the input stream (Live-Video or Recorded Video) and returns the co-ordinates of highly predicted faces predicted by the network.

Pre-requisites:
Python : version >=3.7
Packages required  : 
	1.) imutils --->	command : "python -m pip install imutils"
	2.) cv2	    --->	command : "python -m pip install opencv-python"
	3.) dlib    --->	command : "python -m pip install dlib"

Instructions : 
[NOTE : FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE RUN THE PROGRAM ON "JUPYTER NOTEBOOK"]

In order to execute the program, type "CMD" on the address bar of FILE EXPLORER(Example : This PC > D: > Files )or simply
open command prompt and move to respective directory where the program has been saved. 

type "python Face_detector.py" (shortcut : Type "python Face" and click TAB)

Press Enter to execute the code.


NOTE : This model has shown better results among the best models of face predictor algorithms.
So never mind if it predicts wrongly.

Do like and support!

Hope you'd like it.!
Thanks :)
